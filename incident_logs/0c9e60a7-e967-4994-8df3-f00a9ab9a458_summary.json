This is supported by the fact that the most common log level violations were 287 warning (AuthorizationPatternShift) and 12 critical (ReservationDurationShift). Additionally, the impacted components are AuthorizationPatternShift and ReservationDurationShift, which further reinforces the likelihood of these violations being the root cause.\n\nThe recommended actions are to investigate the root cause of the inconsistent authorization response pattern and inventory reservation taking far longer than expected window, implement additional monitoring to detect similar incidents in the future, consider adjusting the severity threshold for the AuthorizationPatternShift violation to reduce false positives, and consider adjusting the severity threshold for the ReservationDurationShift violation to reduce false positives.\n\nOverall, the incident is classified as warning severity, indicating a moderate level of concern. However, the identified root causes and impacted components should be addressed promptly to prevent further incidents and minimize the impact on the system.",
